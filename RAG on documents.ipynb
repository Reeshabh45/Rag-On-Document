In order to achieve one of the objectives, Central Bureau of Health Intelligence collects data from the health and other relevant sectors, ensuring their overall quality, relevance and timeliness, and converts data into information to support planning, management, and decision making. \\n “N\\national Health Profile” (NHP) has been methodically compiling data on demographic, socio- \\neconomic, health status, health financing indicators, health infrastructure and human resources in health sector in India. Updating information on these areas has made the Profile topical and comprehensive. \\n I \\nwould like to express my gratitude to the many people who saw through this book; to all \\nthose who provided support, talked things over, read, wrote, offered comments, allowed us to share their data and assisted in the editing, proof-reading and design. \\n I \\nthank for the continuous support and co-operation received from all the States and Union \\nTerritories, office of Registrar General of India, National health program divisions, Indian council of medical research, medical/ nursing/ dental councils of India, IRDA and different related union ministries in providing updated information for this important publication. \\n The \\nvaluable support from all the staff of CBHI head quarter and of each field survey units in \\ndata compilation and preparation of analytical write up of publication need special mention.\\n I \\nhope National Health profile with more information and analysis will meet the expectations \\nof our readers.

Health care is not merely medical care, is aligned with cultural understanding of ill health and well-being, extent of socio-economic disparities, reach of health services and quality and costs of care along with current bio-medical understanding about health and illness. \\nHistorically, the Indian commitment to health development has been guided by two principles. The first \\nprinciple is ‘state responsibility’ for health care and the second is free medical care for all, and not merely to those who are unable to pay. Our country began with a glorious tradition of public health, as seen in the references to the descriptions of the Indus valley civilization which mention “Arogya” as reflecting “holistic well-being.” Today, we are a country with tremendous diversity, and therefore, an enormous challenge to the healthcare delivery system. This brings into sharp focus the global commitment of WHO to achieve Universal Health Coverage till 2030 under Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Target 3.8: Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.\\nAyushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana (AB-PMJAY), the government scheme to make health \\ncare facilities available and accessible to the economically weaker segment of the population, is indeed one such step. The year 2022 witnessed further footsteps to empanel more healthcare providers, especially in small towns, towards the aim of having 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centers and covering at least 50 crore beneficiaries from 10 crore financially vulnerable families under Rs. 5 lakh per family, per year coverage in secondary and tertiary care hospitalization, by 2022. With an aim to bring low-cost treatment close to people’s homes while targeting non-communicable diseases, maternal and child health as well as to provide essential drugs and diagnostic services at affordable prices, the government regulations are paving the way for enhanced and customized infrastructure, facilities and technology for creating bigger and collaborated footprints in the country.\\nThe Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri – Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) is the flagship scheme of Government \\nof India that provides a health cover of up to Rs. 5 Lakhs per family per year, for secondary and tertiary hospitalizations to over 10.74 Crore poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 Crore people). Launched on 23rd September 2018, PM- JAY has been designed to provide financial risk protection against catastrophic health expenditure that impoverishes an estimated 6 Crore people every year. The number of individual beneficiaries verified under AB PM-JAY stands at more than 21.90 Crores. Over 26,031 hospitals have been empanelled under the scheme till date. This has facilitated over 4.07 hospitalizations as on 5 January, 2023, saving beneficiaries over Rs. 47,055 Crore in out-of-pocket medical expenditure. It is estimated that Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY has contributed in curtailing out-of-pocket expenditure to the tune of 1.5 to 2 times the actual expenditure recorded under the scheme.\\nThe much desirable National Digital Health Mission NDHM will help create an integrated nationwide database \\nof health service providers, patient records over care continuum and patient consent management using open API framework.

The mission aims to create a management mechanism to process digital health data and facilitates its seamless exchange; develop registries of public and private facilities, health service providers, laboratories and pharmacies; and to support clinical decision-making as well as offer services like telemedicine. The NDHM has the potential to make the health system more evidence based, transparent and efficient. Thus, healthcare has always been a priority sector for India.\\nThe Government of India has made concerted efforts in putting into action policies and programmes that \\nresonate with the targets set in SDGs focusing on reducing Under Five Mortality Rate (U5MR) and Neonatal Mortality Rate, ensuring universal access to health coverage and an increase in recruitment, development, training and the retention of health care service providers.\\nIn India, the rising economic growth with enhanced fiscal capacity of the government, the changing health \\nneeds of the population and the growing incidences of catastrophic expenditure due to health care costs have necessitated a policy and programme response to reach everyone in a comprehensive integrated way. Under the National Health Mission, the Government of India has made concerted efforts to engage all relevant sectors and stakeholders to march in the direction of achieving universal health coverage and delivering quality health care services to all at affordable cost. Concerted and sustained efforts by the Government of India have resulted in significant reductions in maternal mortality ratio and child mortality rate. Today, the Indian health care network is among the largest in the world as it reaches out to every mother and child in the country through a continuum of care approach across all life stages.\\nWith the epidemiological changes that are taking place in India, there will be growing requirement for more \\ninformation on planning of health services so as to facilitate informed decision-making for the benefit of the country. The main sources of health information are the central and state agencies. The indirect sources constitute Census, Civil Registration System and Sample Registration System. While the direct sources encompass the sample surveys and official statistics, which are generally based on built-in information collected for any official programme.\\nWe are entering into a new era in global health. The country is witnessing the process of rapid health \\ntransition, which not only includes demographic and epidemiological transition but nutritional and socio-cultural transitions as well. This has immediate and far reaching implications for health policy making and programme. Further, the demand for health statistics has increased, especially in the context of growing interest on evidence-based planning in health programme as well as promoting the values of transparency and accountability as essential requirements of democratic governance at various levels in India as well as globally.\\nHealth management requires the consistent monitoring of the health status of the population, the provision \\nof services as to the coverage and utility, drugs stocks and consumption patterns, equipment status and availability, Finances, personnel etc. on a regular basis. This requires timely and accurate information from various sources.

The chapter on demographic \\nindicators for India reveals population size, composition, geographic distribution and growth in a given geographical distribution. It also reveals their relationship with social, economic and behavioral factors. Main source of demographic data is population census which is conducted at a decadal interval, vital events registration (Birth, death and marriages), population surveys, population projections and Sample Registration System (SRS) are other sources of demographic data. It examines some of the key aspects that pertain to expected population increase from 121.1 crores to 151.8 crores during the period 2011-2036 - an increase of 25 percent in twenty- five years at the rate of 1.0 percent annually. Similarly, the sex ratio of the total population (females per 1000 males) is expected to increase from 943 in 2011 to 952 during 2036, and the sex ratio at birth is expected to increase from 906 in 2011 (SRS) to 909 in 2031. The proportion of population in the working age-group 15-59 years is expected to rise from 60.7 percent in 2011 to 65.1 percent in 2036. The average age of Indians is expected to be of 34.7 years in 2036 as compared to 24.9 years in 2011. Further, the SRS abridged tables 2013-17; which gives the Life Expectancy of Life at Birth show it has increased from 49.7 years in 1970-75 to 69.0 years in 2013-17. IMR for the country has come down to 28 in 2020 from 50 in 2009, a decline of 20 points over last 10 years and an annual average decline of about 1.6 points. The level of registration of births was 92.7% in 2019.\\nThe chapter on socio-economic status elaborates multi-factorial “conditions” like environmental, material, \\nand personal characteristics that interact elaborately. In this context, the chapter provides with the latest data of the socio-economic indicators, according to State and Union Territory, as these factors influence health/nutrition outcomes through complex pathways of change. The socio-economic factors included in this chapter are “literacy & school enrolment”; “age at effective marriage,”; “economic factors”; “per capita availability of cereals & pulses”; “employment rates,”; and household amenities. The key highlights of the chapter pertain to aspects such as: the gross enrolment ratio for both girls and boys in schools in India in primary grades in 2019-20 was 104.5 and 102.2, respectively. However, by the time students reach higher secondary grades, the enrolment ratio drops to 53.0 and 54.6, respectively. At the national level, the mean age at effective marriage of females remained almost constant at around 22 years from 2016 to 2019.Poverty levels are higher in rural India (26%) than urban (14%) as per Tendulkar Methodology, 2011-12. In 2019-20, among the populous states, per capita Net State Domestic Product at current price with base year 2013-14 was above INR 150,000 in Haryana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana, while it was below INR of 50,000 in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. In 2019-20, Delhi and Sikkim have the highest per capita NDP when Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have the lowest. From 2013 to 2020, the NDP growth rate was highest in Tripura.\\nStrong longitudinal surveillance system is an integral part and a pre-requisite for any morbidity control \\nprogramme, in a geographic area. Using surveillance data from a cross-section of populations (mainly public health facilities) in India, Chapter-3 presents latest burden of Communicable, HIV/AIDS and Non communicable diseases (morbidity) and deaths associated to these morbidities (case fatality) - according to different States and Union Territories, and India as whole. This chapter also provides trends and latest status of maternal and child health situation in India and in its States and Union Territories. Wherever possible, burden of morbidity, deaths and maternal & child health indicators were presented for multiple years, that are most recent. This chapter also provides, cases and deaths due to other communicable diseases like Cholera, Acute Diarrhoeal Morbidity, Enteric Fever(Typhoid), Acute Respiratory Infection, Tetanus ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n"," Document(id_='4ea86fdd-a2c9-4c25-9704-285b8d92e6ec', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '24', 'file_name': 'NHP.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/NHP.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5516144, 'creation_date': '2024-10-20', 'last_modified_date': '2024-10-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='National Health Profile 2022XVINeonatal, Tetanus Other than Neonatal, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Measles, Viral Hepatitis (All Causes), \\nRabies, Pneumonia (All Causes), Meningococcal Meningitis, Syphilis, Gonococcal Infection - in India and its States/UTs in 2020 and 2021 by gender, using data from monthly health condition reports from Directorate of Health Services of the State/UT. Some of the key highlights pertain to: using surveillance data from the public and private sector facilities of all the States & UTs in India, \\nIn 2020, total patients notified for TB was 18,12,151. Out of the total microbiologically confirmed cases \\n(8,43,149 in 2020) of TB, 76% of the patients were successfully treated. With state-wise fluctuations, India has made significant progress in tackling HIV epidemic, from a prevalence of 0.80% in 2003 to 0.24% by 2018-19. In 2021, out of 5.91 crore people screened under National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS): 7.6% were diagnosed with hypertension, 5.93% with diabetes, 2.49% with Hypertension and Diabetes, 0.255% with CVDs, 0.11% with stroke and 0.19% with common cancers.\\nHealthcare financing is increasingly being recognized as an area of major policy relevance to achieve \\nUniversal Health Coverage (UHC). Appropriate Health Financing is a means to ensure adequate funds for health care provide equitable access to all population groups and reduce barriers to utilize health services.\\nThe chapter on Health Financing provides with detailed information on (1) Public Expenditure on Health \\n(2) Average Medical Expenditure and 3) Health Coverage and Insurance. Urban and rural health services constituted 70.11% of the public expenditure on medical and public health in 2018-19 the same has decreases to 69.54% in 2019-20. The per capita expenditure on CGHS during 2021-22 was Rs 10,835. As of 31st March 2021, around 13.16 crores of beneficiaries were covered under ESIS. The per capita expenditure on medical benefit under ESIS is Rs. 716.82 for the year 2021.\\nThe chapter on human resources for health (HRH) focuses on planning, development, performance, \\nmanagement, retention, information, and research on human resources for the health care sector. In recent years, increased awareness of the critical role of HRH in strengthening health system performance and improving population health outcomes has placed the health workforce high on the health agenda. India’s mandate for Universal Health depends to a great extent on adequate and effective HRH providing primary, secondary and tertiary level of care in both private and public sectors. The size and composition of HRH in India has significantly changed during the last decade. The recent health sector reforms in India, particularly since the launch of the National Rural Health Mission, have laid emphasis on strengthening HRH in the public sector system. With regard to the number of registered doctors, among the states, Maharashtra (1,88,540 doctors) has the highest number of registered doctors followed by Tamil Nadu (1,48,216 doctors), Karnataka (1,31,906), and Andhra Pradesh (1,05,795).\\nHealth infrastructure is an important indicator for understanding the health care delivery provisions and \\nwelfare mechanisms in a country. Infrastructure has been described as the basic support for the delivery of public health activities. Public health infrastructure has been referred to as ‘the nerve centre of the public health system’. The chapter on health Infrastructure details out the indicators that are subdivided into three categories viz. educational infrastructure, public infrastructure and regulation of clinical establishments. Medical education infrastructures have shown rapid growth over past few years with 648 medical colleges (396 Government, 252 Private), and 98013 MBBS seats till September, 2022. Currently there are 1962 Institutions for ANM with 59,085 seats for admission, and 9250 institutions with 3,50,679 Nursing seats in the country. .As on 31st March 2021, there are total of 1,57,819 Sub Centres (SCs) (156101 rural + 1718 urban), 30,579 Primary Health Centres (PHCs) (25140 rural + 5439 urban), 5,951 Community Health Centres (CHCs) (5,481 rural + 470 urban), 1224 Sub-divisional Hospitals, 764 District Hospitals, and 307 Medical \\nColleges present across the country. \\n \\n***', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n"," Document(id_='2d20bfa8-c6cf-4709-b447-660de419f3cb', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '25', 'file_name': 'NHP.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/NHP.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5516144, 'creation_date': '2024-10-20', 'last_modified_date': '2024-10-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n"," Document(id_='1515d67e-78a6-4887-abe8-b8bb717cdae0', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '26', 'file_name': 'NHP.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/NHP.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5516144, 'creation_date': '2024-10-20', 'last_modified_date': '2024-10-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text=' \\nCHAPTER ONE\\nDEmOgRAPH iC  \\niND\\ni\\nCATOR\\ns\\nAn overview of Population  \\ns\\ntatistics and Vital \\ns\\ntatistics  \\nof the country.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n"," Document(id_='ee6899a6-066e-462a-b85d-ae621f3e9b0a', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '27', 'file_name': 'NHP.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/NHP.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5516144, 'creation_date': '2024-10-20', 'last_modified_date': '2024-10-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n"," Document(id_='eb94f2dd-5681-46e1-99f6-5a4d8022ec6e', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '28', 'file_name': 'NHP.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/NHP.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5516144, 'creation_date': '2024-10-20', 'last_modified_date': '2024-10-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text=\"1.

It also reveals their relationship with social, economic and behavioral factors. \\nPopulation size refers to quantity of population and can be enumerated by census. The composition deals with quality aspect of population like age, sex, literacy level, occupation, income, marital status, language spoken, and religion. Population growth reveals growth of population over a decade and depends upon fertility, mortality pattern and migration of population. Distribution gives geographical distribution of population in a given country or given area. Demographic Indicators can be divided into two parts: Population Statistics and Vital Statistics. Population Statistics shows trend of population size and growth, sex ratio and population density while Vital Statistics shows trends of birth rate, death rate, life expectancy at birth (LEO), natural \\ngrowth rate and mortality and fertility rates. \\nState/UT wise performance of these indicators helps us to identify areas that need policy and programme \\ninterventions, setting near and far-term goals, and deciding priorities, besides understanding them in an integrated structure.\\nPopulation estimates and Population Projections\\n•\\n I\\nndia’s population, as per census 2011 stood at 12108.5 lakhs (6232.7 lakhs males and 5875.8 \\nlakhs females).

Socio-Economic Indicators\\nHighlights\\nSocio-economic status play s an essential role in the overall health of a person. The inter-relationship \\nbetween health/ nutrition outcomes with socio-economic indicators is not always linear, and at times is \\ncomplicated, poorly understood, and potentially fluctuating across cultures, Socio-economic comprises of multi-factorial “conditions” like environmental, material, and personal characteristics that interact elaborately. The “conditions” reinforce each other through self-perpetuating trickledown spirals, not just on an individual level and “social layer” level, but also at an intergenerational level. In this context, Chapter 2 provides the latest data of the socio-economic indicators, according to State and Union Territory, as these factors influence health/nutrition outcomes through complex pathways of change. The socio-economic factors included in this chapter are “literacy & school enrolment”; “age at effective marriage,”; “economic factors”; “per capita availability of cereals & pulses”; “employment rates,”; and household amenities. \\nKey Points\\nEducation\\n•\\n I\\nn 2011, India’s overall literacy rate was 73%, with urban areas reporting a 16% higher rate (84%) \\nthan rural (68%). Also, there is a 16% gender gap in the overall literacy rate, with males reporting a \\nhigher rate (81%) than females (65%). There also exist wide inter-state variations in overall literacy levels. (Table  2.1.1)\\n•\\n W\\nith a negligible gender gap, the gross enrolment ratio for both girls and boys in India in primary \\ngrades in 2020-21 was near-universal at 104.5% and 102.2%, respectively (Figure 2.2). However, by the time students reach higher secondary grades, the enrolment ratio drops to 53.0% and 54.6% for boys and girls respectively (Table 2.1.2). In 17 States / Union territories, 60% or more girls are enrolled in higher secondary grades and enrolment was below 50% in 11 States.\\nSocial Indicators\\n• At the national level, the  mean age at effective marriage of females remained almost constant at around \\n22 years from 2017 to 2020. The mean age at effective marriage of females in rural India during the same period has marginally improved from 21.7 years in\\n 2017 to 22.2 years by 2020, while in urban areas, \\nit has improved from 21.7 to 23.9 years.    \\nEconomic Indicators\\n• In 2019-20, among the populous states, per capita NDP was above INR 150,000 in Haryana, Karnataka, \\nTamil Nadu, and Telangana, while it was below INR of 50,000 in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. In 2019-20, \\nDelhi and Sikkim have the highest per capita NDP w hen Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have the lowest. \\nHousing and Amenities\\n• As on 18-02-2021, 6062 ha bitations of 139 districts of 17 states were affected by the fluoride problem. \\n•\\n A\\ns on 18-02-2021, 4568 ha bitats of 64 dis tricts had excessive arsenic present in water.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None,

per person in a state at \\na given time. The NDP is a measure of economic output. It is calculated by subtracting capital depreciation from the Gross \\nDomestic Product (GDP), which is the final value of the goods and services produced.

There is no universally accepted definition for safe drinking water. With huge interstate variations, 32% of \\nIndian households in 2011 have access to safe drinking water as they get it through tap with a treated source and another 12% through the tap from an untreated source (Figure 2.6a). Around 34% get drinking water through handpump, 9% through tube well, and 9% through uncovered well. Among the populous states, only in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, 70% or more households use tap water while Odisha, Jharkhand, Assam, and Bihar had less than 15% households use the tap.\\nOn the other hand, 87% of houses in Bihar and 65% in Uttar Pradesh, and 58% in Chhattisgarh used handpump for water. Out of the \\n35 states and union territories, in 11 states, more than 60% of houses have access to drinking water within home premise while in 7 less than 30% house has drinking water sources within the home premise. In Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Jharkhand, almost all the habitations are covered under the national rural water drinking program when the national average was 81% (Table 2.5.2).',

Researchers generally use a survey methodology to gather information about specific area or set of people and use derived statistics to generalize the information about the entire population. The statistical analysis of the parameters under the study is thus used to make a statement about the health of the population.\\n“A health indicator is a measure designed to summarize information about a given priority variable in population \\nhealth or health system performance. Health indicators provide comparable and actionable information across different geographic, organizational or administrative boundaries and/or can track progress over time.”\\n“Using surveillance data from a cross-section of population (mainly public health facilities) in India, Chapter-3 \\npresents latest burden of Communicable, HIV/AIDS and Non-communicable diseases (morbidity) and deaths associated to these morbidity (case fatality) - according to different States and Union Territories, and India as a whole. This chapter also provides trends and latest status of maternal and child health situation in India and in its States and Union Territories. Wherever possible, burden of morbidity, deaths and maternal & child health indicators were presented for multiple years, that are most recent.”\\nNote: Since reported data for almost all the diseases is mainly from Government health facilities, results of \\nthis chapter may have limitations in terms of its completeness as cases and deaths from private medical & health care institutions are not included. All efforts have been made to capture complete and accurate data in respect of Government health facilities, still footnotes have been inserted to indicate status of completeness of figures wherever necessary. Hence, findings of this chapter are indicative and not necessarily confirmative of the situation.\\nCommunicable DiseasesVector Borne Disease MorbidityAs part of communicable disease surveillance, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), an \\numbrella programme, provides clinically suspected burden (annual number of cases) of vector borne diseases viz. Malaria, Dengue, Chikungunya, Kala-azar, Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES), and Japanese Encephalitis (JE), and associated deaths – as per ICD classification, in India as well as according to states & Union Territories (UT), for multiple years, wherever possible. \\nThe surveillance is carried out through three types of sentinel sites (Sentinel Surveillance Sites with laboratory \\nfacilities, Sentinel Surveillance Sites without laboratory facilities; other Reporting Units).\\nBox 1 and Figure 3.1 presents clinically suspected burden of vector borne diseases in India, in 2021.

Thus, appropriate Health Financing is a means to ensure adequate funds for health care, provide equitable access to all population groups and reduce barriers to utilize health services. This chapter on Health Financing will provide detailed information on – (1) Public Health Expenditure on Health; (2) Average Medical Expenditure; and (3) Health Coverage and Insurance.\\n H\\nealth Finance indicators provide an understanding of patterns of investments, expenditure, sources \\nof funding and proportion of allocation vis-à-vis other total allocations.  It also provides an important tool to understand health outcomes in relation to the expenditure.\\n•\\n T\\notal public expenditure on health (in actual) for the year 2018-19 was Rs. 2,06,647.24 Crores which \\nincludes State Budget (Own Expenditure) Rs.1,36,561.64 Crores, Centre MoHFW + M/o Ayush Rs.56,235.80 Crores, Other Central Ministries Rs. 12,735.52 Crores and UTs Rs.1,114.28 Crores.

Public Expenditure on Health\\nBudget Estimates (BE): The ‘Budget Estimate’ for any Ministry or Scheme is the amount allocated to it in \\nthe budget papers for the following year. For instance, in the budget speech in February 2022, the Finance Minister presented budget estimates for expenditures under various heads for the Financial Year, 2022-23 which runs from April 2022 to March 2023.\\nRevised Estimates (RE): Once the Financial Year gets underway, some Ministries may need more funds than \\nwas actually allocated to them under the budget estimates. The government approaches parliament with such supplementary requests for funds during the course of the financial year (in the monsoon or winter session). These supplementary demands are reflected in the revised estimates for the current year (2022-23). Thus, along with budget estimates for 2023-24, the Finance Minister also presents the revised estimates for 2022-23.\\nActuals:  Actual expenditures are the final amounts spent under different heads and may exceed (or fall short \\nof) the Revised Estimates. Since the actual expenditure can only be assessed once the financial year is over \\nand final accounts have been prepared, the Actual expenditures presented in the budget papers are for the earlier Financial Year i.e. for the year 2021-22.\\nThe three main categories of public expenditure on health are Medical and Public Health, Family Welfare and \\nOthers. These are explained below.\\n4.1.1.

Mode of Implementation\\nVarious States are using different models for implementing their own health insurance/ assurance schemes. \\nSome of them are using the services of insurance companies while others are directly implementing the schemes in their States.\\nConsidering the fact that States are at different levels of preparedness and have varying capacity to manage \\nsuch schemes, AB PM-JAY provides flexibility to States to choose their implementation model. They can implement scheme through assurance / trust model, insurance model or mixed model. \\nModes of Implementation No. of States\\nTrust 23\\nHybrid 4\\nInsurance 6\\n5.1Assurance Model / Trust Model\\nThis is the most common implementation model adopted by most of the States. Under this model, the scheme \\nis directly implemented by the SHA without the intermediation of the insurance company. The financial risk of implementing the scheme is borne by the State Government in this model. SHA essentially reimburses health care providers directly. Even though no insurance company is involved, the SHA employ the services of an Implementation Support Agency (ISA) for claim management and related activities.\\n5.2 Insurance Model\\nIn the insurance model, the SHA competitively selects an insurance company through a tendering process \\nto manage PM-JAY in the State. Based on market determined premium, SHA pays premium to the insurance company per eligible family for the policy period and insurance company, in turn, does the claims settlement and payments to the service provider. The financial risk for implementing the scheme is also borne by the insurance company in this model.\\n5.3 Mixed Model\\nUnder this, the SHA engages both the assurance/ trust and insurance models mentioned above in various \\ncapacities with the aim of being more economic, efficient, providing flexibility and allowing convergence with the State scheme.

Key Initiatives Undertaken in PM-JAY\\n6.1 COVID-19 Related Intervention\\nNational Health Authority (NHA) has been providing necessary support to States/UTs for ensuring free COVID-19 \\ntesting and treatment to all eligible beneficiaries under Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY). However, Public Health being a State subject, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been primarily directed by the State Governments. Many State / UT Governments decided to make COVID-19 testing and treatment free for all residents. While some of them used AB PM-JAY ecosystem including the NHA’s IT platform, others made it free but without recording the transaction on NHA’s IT platform. As per the data obtained from NHA IT platform and sourced from States* using their own IT systems, a total more than 8.75 Lakh hospital admissions amounting to Rs. 3129.44 Crores have been authorized under the scheme for the treatment of COVID-19. The public private split of the same is provided below for kind perusal. Further, NHA call center took initiative of dissemination of information on COVID-19 precautionary measures via National Helpline Number “1075”.\\n6.2 Anti-Fraud Initiatives \\nThe National Anti-Fraud Unit (NAFU) along with the State Anti-Fraud Units (SAFUs) under- took various \\nmeasures to strengthen the integrity service providers across the operational framework of the AB PM- JAY. Additionally, the NHA has partnered with SAS, a globally renowned advanced analytics solutions provider to develop a comprehensive Fraud Analytics Control and Tracking System (FACTS) to proactively detect fraud, suspect transactions, service providers and beneficiaries. Some of the key highlights are as follows:\\nKey actions taken: Some of the major achievements of NAFU are as follows:\\n• 2 10 Hospitals de-empanelled due to involvement in fraudulent activities. \\n•\\n Ar\\nound 18,000 PMAM/CSC IDs have been deactivated. \\n•\\n 2\\n1 cr. penalties have been levied on the errant entities.\\n6.3 Quality Assurance \\nOne of the primary goals and key focus area of the Scheme is to provide quality healthcare to its beneficiaries. \\nTo ensure that quality services are delivered via EHCPs, NHA has developed the following mechanism:\\n•\\n M\\nonthly Quality Audit Checklist: This has been developed for periodic assessment and monitoring \\nof the quality of services provided by Empanelled Health Care Providers. \\n•\\n P\\nM-JAY Quality Certification:  NHA has partnered with Quality Council of India (QCI) to develop a \\nportal for online quality certification of empanelled hospitals. These quality certifications include \\nBronze/Silver/Gold Quality certifications. In this regard, an online portal has also been developed to make the process of application seamless and easy for the EHCPs. An app has also been developed by QCI to make the response process and closure of non-Compliance found during assessment process of certification easy for the EHCPs.\\n•\\n P\\nM-JAY Quality dashboard: This was launched to aid States/UTs to monitor the progress of EHCPs \\nwho have applied for PM-JAY quality certification. As of 20.10.2022, a total of 282 empanelled hospitals have been certified under these quality guidelines. \\n•\\n V\\nalue Based Incentive System: In order to encourage the empanelled healthcare providers for \\nprovision of quality of care, AB PM-JAY has introduced a new concept wherein the healthcare provider shall be incentivised for the improvement of quality of life of patients being treated under the AB PM-JAY scheme.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n"," Document(id_='946cec59-0dc3-44cc-a24e-289a4399106d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '309', 'file_name': 'NHP.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/NHP.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5516144, 'creation_date': '2024-10-20', 'last_modified_date': '2024-10-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='National Health Profile 20222846.4 Health Benefits Packages\\nAn exercise was undertaken in 2021-22 for restructuring and rationalization of the health benefit packages \\n(HBP) An exhaustive exercise was initiated by the HPQA Division to rationalize the HBP to make it more comprehensive & inclusive where every stakeholder’s concern was addressed.The latest HBP 2022 has 1,121 treatment packages comprising 1,949 procedures across 27 Specialities, expanding access to various treatments and a scientific integration of implants and high-end consumables within the packages along with differential pricing for packages based on the location of hospital. A new specialty like Palliative medicine has been added in HBP 2022. Unbundling of High-end drug & diagnostic packages was done to enable better utilisation of the packages. Bone marrow transplant & cochlear implant - a new high-end package has been added. Differential price of packages has also been introduced as per the tier structure of the city.\\n6.5 Standard Treatment Guidelines\\nThe Standard Treatment Process documentation has been developed and released with the aim to give an \\noverview of the process entailed specific to the Health Benefits Packages under AB PM-JAY. A total of 647 STGs covering 1508 procedures have been prepared and integrated with the Transaction Management System of AB PM-JAY.\\n6.6 ICD-11 / ICHI & DRG \\nTo strengthen the patient classification and provider payment system under PMJAY the ICD-11 has been \\nintroduced for standardized diagnosis coding, ICHI for classifying health interventions, and Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) to ensure the reimbursement based upon the resources intensity required for each specific patient mix.  As on date, the ICD-11/ICHI has been implemented under the Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY in 22 states and 9 UTs. The DRG pilot has been initiated in the States of Kerala, Haryana, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, and Chhattisgarh.\\n6.7 Capacity Building: \\nNational Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (‘NPCSCB’) - includes initiatives that range from \\nstrengthening existing institutions, refreshing policy, detailing competencies that are required for each role and activity related to each position, and creating a strong push for a culture of life-long learning among civil services. The Programme is underpinned by IGOT Karmayogi - a comprehensive online platform that has resources for online, face-to-face and blended learning. The NPCSCB – “Mission Karmayogi” has been launched with the objective of enhancing governance through Civil Service Capacity Building. Mission Karmayogi will have the following six pillars: Policy framework, Institutional framework, Competency framework, Digital learning framework, Electronic human resource management system, Monitoring and evaluation framework. \\n6.8 Convergence \\nNational health authority launched an initiative to converge Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY with various national \\nschemes to allow various ministries to leverage NHA’s robust and versatile platform to augment healthcare outcomes. Convergence reduces implementation costs by preventing duplication of efforts and resources while providing a more accessible and standardised quality service to beneficiaries across all schemes.  \\nSome of the major achievements under Scheme convergence are as follows:\\n•  C entral Government Health Scheme - Complete migration of the Central Government Health \\nScheme (CGHS) to the AB PM-JAY IT platform with the onboarding of 1879 healthcare providers \\nacross the nation who have provided cashless service to CGHS pensioners raised claims worth more than Rs. 3135.83 Crores.\\n•\\n A\\nyushman CAPF - Convergence of Ayushman CAPF for more than 35 Lakh beneficiaries including ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n"," Document(id_='174aa5d5-7980-4821-9b87-2aedb3f55a6a', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '310', 'file_name': 'NHP.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/NHP.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5516144, 'creation_date': '2024-10-20', 'last_modified_date': '2024-10-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='National Health Profile 2022285serving CAPF personnel and their dependents along with printing and distribution of more than 7 \\nlakh beneficiary cards. 2.29 lakh claims have been received worth Rs 287.6 Cr under the scheme. \\n•\\n E\\nmployee State Insurance Scheme (ESIS): Hospital admissions worth INR 2.9 Cr in more than 157 \\ndistricts across the nation in Employee State Insurance Scheme.\\n•\\n F\\null migration to Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi and Health Minister’s Discretionary Grants to PM-JAY IT \\nsystem ensuring faster turn-around times by optimising scheme workflow.\\n•\\n B\\nuilding and Other Construction Workers’ Scheme (BoCW) for Bihar, Chandigarh and Uttar Pradesh \\nand verified over 70,000 beneficiaries.\\n•\\n S\\ncheme for Transgender: On 24th August 2022, an MoU between NHA & MoSJE has been signed \\nto provide comprehensive health care benefits (AB PM-JAY benefits along with Sex Reassignment Surgery benefit) to the Transgender beneficiary who is holding a certificate issued by National Portal for Transgender Persons up to Rs. 5 Lakh per beneficiary per year under SMILE (Transgender Swasthya Suraksha) scheme initiated by MoSJE.\\n6.9 Service Provider Operations \\nThe Hospital Operations (HO) Division has been established as an eminent section of NHA to improve the \\nengagement with empanelled healthcare providers so that two-way communication between NHA and EHCPs could be established. \\nHO Division liaisons with SHAs, DIUs & central ministries for providing all the required support. For effective \\nliaising and coordination, HO division conducts electronic engagement with EHCPs (mass SMS, emails etc), regular video conferences, webinars, field visits, and direct calling to understand the operational issues & suggest possible solutions. HO division is also responsible for providing direct support to empanelled healthcare providers situated in states/ UTs currently not onboarded for the AB PM-JAY scheme. \\nKey achievements \\n• T otal ~4182 inactive EHCPs have been activated (~2,420 EHCPs that had zero pre-auth since \\nempanelment & ~1762 EHCPs which were inactive in last six months but active before) \\n•\\n 4\\n6 Field visits to 622 inactive & low performing EHCPs across 23 States/UTs have been conducted \\nto understand the issues and challenges of the inactive hospitals and provide the requisite support. \\n•\\n R\\negular electronic engagement with all EHCPs is being conducted via direct calling, weekly Mass \\nSMS, and Mass E-mailers throughout States/UTs.

In addition, 74 trainings have been facilitated across states/UTs with ~6,880 participants from SHA, DIUs, EHCPs, ISA/ TPA as per requisition.\\n6.10 Service Provider Empanelment\\nThe supply of health care services under AB PM-JAY are ensured through pre-selected, well equipped and \\nwell-prepared hospitals to deliver the benefits. Also, the hospitals must be distributed widely enough over the geography so as to ensure optimal accessibility to the eligible families. In order to cater to the increased demands under AB PM-JAY and also to ensure quality healthcare to the beneficiaries, it is imperative to ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n"," Document(id_='6a445fde-26da-449a-b0bb-ec1d583c14a4', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '311', 'file_name': 'NHP.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/data/NHP.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5516144, 'creation_date': '2024-10-20', 'last_modified_date': '2024-10-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='National Health Profile 2022286maintain and grow a network of hospitals that also conform to the quality standards and criteria.  As of 31st \\nOctober 2022, a total of 26, 031 hospitals have been empanelled under AB PM-JAY. \\nThe initiatives taken by NHA with regard to the creation of hospital network are as follows:\\n• E mpanelment of hospitals under Central government ministries:  In order to ensure that beneficiaries are able to seek \\ntreatment closer to their homes, NHA has empanelled all eligible hospitals under Government of India under AB PM-JAY. \\nThese include hospitals from Ministry of Coal, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Power and Ministry of Railways among others. \\n•\\n D\\nirect empanelment for private hospitals: Beneficiaries may need to get treatment in States which are not implementing \\nAB PM-JAY. For this purpose, NHA has introduced the process of directly empanelling private healthcare providers in such States.\\n•\\n R\\nevision of empanelment policy: NHA has revised existing guidelines for empanelment and de-empanelment under AB \\nPM-JAY. Bearing in mind that dialysis is a procedure which needs to be performed regularly for patients suffering from chronic renal disease, NHA has decided to empanel standalone dialysis centres for better facilitation of the necessary \\nservices to the PM-JAY beneficiaries .\\n6.11 Towards beneficiary awareness and IEC:\\nA de tailed communication strategy has been developed by NHA, which is implemented at the national and \\nregional levels. Various modes of communication such as leaflets, booklets, hoardings, TV, radio spots, \\ninterpersonal communication, etc., have been used as important elements for creating a comprehensive communication strategy for disseminating the desired messages across the target audience.  Some of the key actions undertaken are listed below:\\nCelebration of Arogya Manthan: Ayushman Bharat – Arogya Manthan is organized around 23rd September \\nevery year to celebrate the launch day of the AB PM-JAY scheme. In the year 2022, Arogya Manthan has been organized on 25th & 26th celebrating four years of successful implementation of the scheme. International Public Health experts from various South Asian countries and from different corners of the world participated in the event as guest speakers. \\nBeneficiary Interaction Session: On the eve of Ayushman Bharat Diwas, a “Beneficiary Interaction” Session \\nwas organized virtually on 23rd September, 2022 by National Health Authority. In this event, Shri Mansukh \\nMandaviya, Hon’ble Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare and Chemicals & Fertilizers interacted with Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY beneficiaries who shared their experiences while availing the benefits scheme. It has been apparent that the Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY scheme has been able to bring remarkable changes in the lives of poor and vulnerable section of the population.\\nArogya Samvad: To create a platform for enlightened conversation, National Health Authority (NHA) releases \\n‘Arogya Samvad’ a monthly newsletter outlining the latest development on Ayushman Bharat PM – JAY. e-RUPI: Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, 2nd August 2021, virtually launched India’s new \\ndigital solution, e-RUPI. NHA coordinated with Prime Minister’s Office to support in the launch of this digital \\npayment solution. ‘e-RUPI’ is a cashless and contactless instrument for digital payment, launched by NPCI which can be redeemed by the user without any card, digital payments app or internet banking app, at the service provider.\\nAdhikar Patra: Adhikar Patra is issued to the beneficiaries during their hospital admissions for treatment under \\nPM-JAY scheme to make them aware about their rights so that they can claim free and cashless healthcare \\nservices upto Rs 5 lakhs under the scheme. \\nAbhinandan Patra: Abhinandan Patra—a ‘thank you note’ is issued to the beneficiaries during their discharge \\nafter the treatment under PM-JAY for availing the benefits under the scheme.

The goal is to synergise knowledge and skills in order to make the implementation of AB PM-JAY more effective. NHA has actively collaborated with a number of organizations including German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), World Bank, World Health Organisation, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Clinton Health Access Initiative, National Skill Development Corporation, ICICI Foundation for Inclusive Growth, Asian Development Bank, Akshaya Patra Foundation, Bharti Foundation, Novartis Social Business, NATHEALTH, WISH Foundation, Insurance Institute of India, Department of Health Research - National Cancer Grid, Quality Council of India, International Innovation Corps - University of Chicago.\\n7. Key Programmatic Interventions \\nNHA has launched multiple programmatic interventions to improve the performance of the scheme. Some of \\nthe major initiatives are being listed as below: \\n7.1 Aapke Dwar Ayushman\\n“Aapke Dwar Ayushman” (ADA) is a mission-mode campaign implemented by NHA focusing on engagement of grassroots \\nfunctionaries such as frontline healthcare workers, Panchayati Raj personnel, and village level functionaries. NHA has onboarded Card creation agencies including CSC and UTIITSL for beneficiary mobilization and card creation.\\n7.2 Database enrichment\\nNHA has embarked on an exercise – in coordination with Central ministries implementing well-received welfare \\nschemes such as Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), National Food Security Act (NFSA) – to enrich the SECC 2011 database. This was done to address the gaps in the existing beneficiary identification system and lay the groundwork for the Ayushman card saturation program in the days ahead.\\nSP&C division took the lead in conceptualizing the idea of database enrichment and further coordinating with \\nnodal ministries such as the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG), Department of Food & Public Distribution (DoFPD), Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).\\n7.3 PM – JAY Mobile Application\\nNational Health Authority has recently revamped the card creation process, where a new mobile application \\nhas been developed to ensure Ayushman card saturation in a time bound manner.

Accordingly, the SP&C division conceptualized the “Joint Review Mission”. The JRM will undertake a thorough, periodic, and time-bound evaluation of AB PM-JAY by interacting with stakeholders at the last mile viz. beneficiaries, empanelled hospitals, implementation support agencies, district implementation units, etc. The JRM will therefore serve as a valuable mechanism for NHA and State Health Agencies (SHAs) to closely monitor the on-ground progress of AB PM-JAY and institute programmatic and strategic changes in the scheme. JRMs have already been constituted in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh.\\n7.5 PM-JAY Inter-division coordination unit (PICU)\\nNHA has instituted a PM-JAY Inter-division coordination unit (PICU). This was formed by NHA to undertake \\nintegrated evaluation of AB PM-JAY performance across States / UTs. Accordingly, the PICU consists of members from all divisions of NHA. The PICU is intended a management control platform for NHA to assess the scheme’s performance across multiple qualitative and quantitative indicators.\\nEvery PICU shall conduct regular visits to assigned States/ UTs of their Zone. PICU shall conduct detailed analysis \\nof the data available on public domain and NHA dashboards, findings of earlier field visits, domain-specific requests received from States and insights from other reliable resources. PICU visits have be conducted in Mizoram and Manipur.\\n7.6 Beneficiary Facilitation Agency\\nAs part of efforts to streamline the implementation of AB PM-JAY at empanelled public hospitals, NHA has \\ndeveloped the concept of beneficiary facilitation agencies (BFA). The BFAs are being gradually deployed by the States. BFAs are incentivized to increase the uptake of services under the scheme by actively screening and canvassing IPD patients and bring them under the ambit of AB PM-JAY (if eligible). Wider adoption of BFAs will therefore lead to increased awareness of AB PM-JAY especially among weaker sections of rural areas, who go to public hospitals.\\nThe status with regard to the adoption of BFA by States/UTs are as follows:\\nS. No Status States/UTs\\n1 BFA Deployed Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Tripura, Himachal Pradesh, \\nPunjab, Maharashtra\\n2 In Progress Jharkhand, Jammu & Kashmir \\n3 States / UTs Contemplating A&N Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Chandigarh, Haryana, Gujarat, Ladakh, \\nManipur, Nagaland, Puducherry, Sikkim\\n4 Others Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, DNH & DD, Goa, Kerala, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Lakshadweep, Karnataka\\n7.7 Green Channel Payment\\nTimely processing of claims raised under Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY is essential to ensure participation of \\nempanelled hospitals under the scheme. NHA is setting up a Green Channel Payment (GCP) mechanism to encourage greater participation of EHCPs in treating AB PM-JAY beneficiaries on a regular basis. \\nUnder the GCP , partial claim amount of 50% shall be instantly released to a select group of empanelled \\nhospitals for ‘above board’ claims.

The \\nhospitals which are eligible for GCP must not have any suspicious cases/confirmed fraud/disciplinary action and must have been empanelled for at least 6 months.\\n7.8 e-RUPI \\ne-RUPI is a digital payment solution developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). This \\nseamless person and purpose specific one-time payment mechanism enables users to pay for goods and services through a pre-paid voucher without a card, digital payments app or internet banking. e-RUPI is easy, safe, and secure and it keeps the details of the beneficiaries completely confidential. The entire transaction process through this voucher is relatively faster and, at the same time it is very reliable.\\nLooking at the far-reaching benefits of e-RUPI, e-RUPI is being leveraged for payment of diagnostic services delivery under AB PM-JAY. In this regard, a pilot has successfully been launched in Chandigarh.\\n7.9 Ayushman Mitra\\nAnother key initiative launched by NHA is ‘Ayushman Mitra’ which provides an opportunity to all citizens to \\ncontribute to the vision of Ayushman Bharat by helping eligible people to get their Ayushman Cards created and bring them under the ambit of the scheme. While getting Ayushman Cards and availing treatments under the scheme, the Ayushman Mitra ID can be shared by beneficiaries to CSC/empanelled hospital.\\n8. Budget Provision\\nAB PM-JAY is completely funded by the Government and the costs are shared between Central and State \\nGovernments. The budget allocation for the fiscal year 2022-23 is Rs. 6,412 Crore out of which Rs. 3,362 Crore has been spent as on 26.10.2022.\\nSharing Pattern Ratio\\nAB PM-JAY is completely funded by the Government and the costs are shared between Central and State Governments. The ratio of Central share to State share for all States, except North-Eastern States and three Himalayan States and Union Territories with legislature, is 60:40, with the Centre’s share being 60 percent and the State’s share is 40 percent.

The application is an interface to use the facilities envisaged under ABDM like the \\ncreation of an ABHA address, linking & viewing of health records and managing user consents. The application also allows the self-uploading/scanning of existing physical health records and sharing of digital health records such as diagnostic reports, prescriptions, Co-WIN vaccination certificates, etc.\\n5.       U nified Health Interface (UHI): The major focus of ABDM is interoperability, i.e., seamless exchange of information \\namong users. UHI is an extension of interoperability among different platforms or open protocols. \\nSandbox\\nSandbox is a testing environment for applications being developed by integrators from the health-tech industry \\nand enabled with ABDM. This Sandbox is used by testers to mimic the characteristics of the production environment and create simulated responses from all APIs the application relies on.

Considering ABDM is a one-of-its-kind mission, various capacity-building initiatives were undertaken to enhance knowledge on digital health, comparison with other countries implementing digital health systems, and various building blocks of ABDM. The Capacity Building initiatives encompass all the stakeholders for ABDM viz., state ABDM officers and health authorities, internal NHA stakeholders, healthcare professionals, facility administration and staff, integrators, and the general public.\\nChallenges Faced and Way Forward\\nABDM’s mission emphasizes shifting the focus from “illness” to “wellness”, “facility centric” to “patient-centric” \\nand “platform-centric” to “network-centric”. Accordingly, the basic building blocks have been developed and further policies and supporting digital building blocks are in process. This will help boost access to healthcare for citizens through technologies such as telemedicine and enable continuity of care by helping citizens have access to their digital health records from various health facilities and health programs. Searching for health services, doctors etc. will become seamless across the ecosystem, as all integrated partners will operate on the same rules and technology principles (such as open Application Programming Interface - APIs).\\nWhile ABDM is in the process of integrating the healthcare ecosystem and making it interoperable, there are \\ncertain challenges like lack of adequate hardware & software infrastructure in health facilities, resistance to change, and lack of incentives to adopt ABDM. New real life use cases are being developed so that citizens can see for themselves the actual use of digital technology in health care and how it makes their experiences in health care ecosystem better. For eg. Scan and Share functionality has been developed where the patients can share their demographic profile with the hospital through the QR (quick response) codes. As ABDM will play a pivotal role in structuring and transitioning of the Indian health ecosystem to a digital environment, NHA is focusing on driving adoption by public and private healthcare providers. This will ensure that a wider range of digital health services are available for citizens, thereby fueling the self-sustaining platform.\\nOther Central Schemes of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare\\na) \\n H\\nealth Minster’s Discretionary Grant (HMDG)\\n \\n F\\ninancial assistance up to a maximum of Rs. 1.25 lakh is provided to the indigent patients from the \\nHealth Minister’s Discretionary Grant (HMDG) to defray a part of the expenditure on hospitalization \\n/ treatment in Government hospitals for life threatening diseases like Cancer, and that of Kidney, Liver, Heart, Rare Disease etc. covered under Umbrella Scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi, in cases where free medical facilities are not available.

They include inter - alia physicians, nursing professionals, pharmacists, midwives, dentists, allied \\nhealth professionals, community health workers, social health workers etc. Human resources for Health (HRH) also include other health care providers, as well as health management and support personnel - those who may not deliver services directly but are essential for effective health system functioning along with health services managers, medical records and health information technicians, health economists, health supply chain managers, medical secretaries and others.\\nFocus areas in HRH include planning, development, performance, management, retention, information, and \\nresearch on human resources for the health care sector. In recent years, consequent upon the crisis and menace of Pandemic increased awareness of the critical role of HRH in strengthening health system performance and improving population health outcomes has placed the health workforce high on the current agenda.\\nIndia’s mandate for Universal Health depends to a great extent on adequate and effective HRH providing \\nprimary, secondary and tertiary level of care in both private and public sectors.  The size and composition of HRH in India has significantly improved during the last decades.\\nThe recent health sector reforms in India, particularly since the launch of the National Rural Health Mission, \\nhave laid emphasis on strengthening HRH in the public sector system.\\nThe National Health Policy, 2017 recommends that the principal aspect around policy on HRH is embedded in \\nworkforce performance within the system and can be further optimized when we have the most appropriate person in terms of both skills and motivation, for the right job in right place, working in the right professional environment with appropriate incentives.\\nIn the Indian context health workforce information systems had limitations of reliable and timely data that is \\nintegral to effective policy making. HRH data in India is managed by several stakeholders including states and the National Health Mission.\\nIn last few years several steps have been taken by departments as well as different regulatory bodies to \\nstrengthen data, although a lot more strengthening of systems is the need of the hour.

Health infrastructure is an important indicator for understanding the health care delivery provisions and welfare mechanisms in a country. Infrastructure has been described as the basic support for the delivery of public health activities. Public health infrastructure has been referred to as ‘the nerve center of the public health system’. It also signifies the investments and priority accorded to create the infrastructure in public and privatesectors. Article 47 of the Constitution of India mandates improvement in public health, thus government is required to take all measures for this purpose.  \\nl I n India, the private sector plays an important role in service provision with 80% of outpatient and \\n60% of total inpatient care provided by private sector (60thRound of NSSO). \\nl T he National Health Mission followed by National Health Policy 2017 lays major thrust on addressing \\nthe infrastructural needs and gaps. National Health Policy further recommends strengthening of regulatory role of MOHFW in regulation of clinical establishments and profession & technical education. \\nl T o understand the Health Infrastructure indicators the section can be subdivided into three categories \\nviz. educational infrastructure, public infrastructure and regulation of clinical establishments.\\nKey Points:\\nEducation Infrastructure\\nl Med ical Ed ucation infrastructure has shown rapid growth over past few years with 648 medical \\ncolleges (396 Government; 252 Private), and 98013 MBBS seats till September, 2022.\\nl T here are 9445 DNB (Diplomate of National Board) seats and 1372 CPS sheets available across the \\ncountry. \\nl A t present there are 318 dental colleges out of which 277 colleges have MDS seats.
